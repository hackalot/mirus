If you've made some changes to the code that you'd like to see in the project, have an idea for us, or have an issue, we're happy to hear your input and accept your pull requests!

### Basic Contributing Guidelines
We try to have a very clean and elegant codebase.  As such, any code submitted to us must follow our [coding style](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/wiki/Coding-style). Any code that is not formatted, named, or otherwise not compliant to the Style Guide will be rejected.  Please note that this is nothing personal.  It's just business.

### Mailing List
If you want to get involved, you should join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mirus-dev) and introduce yourself.  If you are unsure of what you want to work on, take a look through our [small tasks](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues?labels=in-progress&page=1&state=open) or ask and we can get you something to keep yourself busy.

### Submitting Issues
If you run into a bug or find a problem, we *highly* recommend you submit it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).  Please make sure to title your issue descriptively, as well as tag it correctly.  Issues may be marked as `wont-fix` if a clear enough description is not provided.  Please describe what you were doing to cause the issue, any error codes that appear, and steps to reproduce.  We may also ask for log files, so have those handy.

### Feature Requests
You may use the issue tracker to request features.  Follow the general guidelines for submitting an issue, but tag your request with `feature-request`.  Please note that we do not accept requests for features that seem "immature", "insane", or that do not line up with the project goals.  Ex: "plz put da w1nd0s and mac nd l1nyx w4r3z in ur os d00ds".  Please do not do this, as you will be laughed at behind your back, marked as `wont-fix`, and your issue will be put in the hall of shame.

### Branches
The `master` branch contains stable code that builds - all bleeding-edge development goes on in the `develop` branch and its children.  Fork the project, and create a feature branch off of `develop` to do your work on.  Throw us a pull request and we will patch you in if everything checks out.  We do not accept pull requests directly to `master`.
