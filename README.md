Mirus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshbeitler/mirus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshbeitler/mirus)

Mirus is a hobby operating system designed to be a playground for new and interesting OS theories.  It is not based on any other exsisting standards, allowing for a great deal of freedom in the development of the concepts behind it.

## Features ##
* The basics (gdt, irq, isrs, kprintf)

## Testing ##
Mirus will build fine on most Unix systems that have the dependencies installed, and possibly with Mingw/Cygwin (not tested).  Normal development takes place on Fedora 18.

Once the dependencies are met, you can clone the repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git`

And build with `make all`.  To generate a distribution package, perform `make dist`.

Make will build, link, and generate an ISO image of Mirus using grub2.  This can be run in your favorite VM or on physical hardware.  You can run `make kvm` to run in QEMU.  Note that we currently only officially support QEMU and VirtualBox.

## Dependencies

### Kernel
To build the Mirus kernel, you will need `nasm`, `clang`, and `GNU ld`.  In order to build the ISO image, Mirus uses the `grub2-mkrescue` utility found in the grub2 utilities collection. (Which you probably have if your system uses GRUB2)
