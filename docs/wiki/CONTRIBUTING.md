# Contributing to Mirus
If you've made some changes to the code that you'd like to see in the project, have an idea for us, or have an issue, we're happy to hear your input and accept your pull requests!

### Basic Contributing Guidelines
We try to have a very clean and elegant codebase.  As such, any code submitted to us must follow the Mirus Style Guide.  Any code that is not formatted, named, or otherwise not compliant to the Style Guide will be regected.  Please note that this is nothing personal.  It's just business.

### Mailing List
In order to contribute, you need to join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mirus-dev), and send a message introducing yourself.  We'd be glad to help dish out easy starting tasks.

### Submitting Issues
If you run into a bug or find a problem, we *highly* recommend you submit it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).  Please make sure to title your issue descriptivly, as well as tag it correctly.  Issues may be marked as `wont-fix` if a clear enough description is not provided.  Please describe what you were doing to cause the issue, any error codes that appear, and steps to reproduce.  We may also ask for log files, so have those handy.

### Feature Requests
You may use the issue tracker to request features.  Follow the general guidelines for sumitting an issue, but tag your request with `feature-request`.  Please note that we do not accept requests for features that seem "immature", "insane", or that do not line up with the project goals.  Ex: "plz put da w1nd0s and mac nd l1nyx w4r3z in ur os d00ds".  Please do not do this, as you will be laughed at behind your back, marked as `wont-fix`, and your issue will be put in the hall of shame.
