Mirus naming conventions
========================

File names
----------

1) all files MUST have extensions
2) filenames must be descriptive

If a filetype has an extension listed below, please use it.

    c++
        source      .cpp
        header      .hpp
    c
        source      .c
        header      .h
    shell           .sh
    viml            .vim
    text            .txt
    assembly        .asm
    html            .html


File content
------------

* When writing simple text-docs, please use the format found
  in `example.txt`.

* Keep ALL line lengths in ALL files UNDER 80 characters, unless
  you absolutly MUST go over

* Keep files uniformly wide


General naming notes
--------------------

* We generally prefer longer, more descriptive names to shorter
  ones.  Examples:
    
    "sys"       ->      "system"
    "lib"       ->      "libary"
    "dir"       ->      "directory"

  This is not the olden days.  We can afford a few extra
  keystrokes.

* Most of these guidelines apply to directories and files, BUT
  not the naming conventions INSIDE source files.  See each
  format's guideline file for that

* Gleam what you can from the rest of the source

* Everything should look like 1 person wrote it (which is probably
  true...)

* SPELL CORRECTLY
