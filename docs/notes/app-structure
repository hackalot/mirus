mirus user-end app structure notes
==================================

every application on mirus should follow a similar app layout speed
newcomers to projects on development and provide a standard base
to work from (a la rails).

proposed:


    <project-name>/
        |- docs/                                project documentation, notes, screens, etc.
        |- source/                              all source files
        |   |- <project-name>/                  base source files (.cs, .cpp, .rb, etc.)
        |   |- include/                         header files (if any)
        |   |- library/                         and libraries used
        |- support/                             project intro information
        |   |- building.txt
        |   |- license.txt
        |   |- readme.txt
        |   |- contributing.txt
        |- build/                               any files needed for building; project files, etc.


should mirror os sources

maybe mirror (on mirus systems) or symlink a file README in the root directory to `support/readme.txt`,
to help keep consistancy with non-mirus ecosystems.
