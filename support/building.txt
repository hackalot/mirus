Building Mirus

In order to build Mirus, you should have a copy of the source as well as the following dependencies:

* make
* ld
* clang
* nasm
* grub2-utils
* xorriso

Makefile targets are as follows:

all:		build mirus and produce iso image
clean:		clean up all object and output files
kvm:		run in qemu
dist:		generate a tar.gz of the source and binaries
todolist:	generate a list of // TODO:s, // ERROS:s, and // NOTE:s
debug:      builds with additional debug symbols and turns kernel debug mode on

The resulting ISO file will be called `mirus.iso` - that is what you are interested in.
